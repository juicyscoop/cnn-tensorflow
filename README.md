Dataset
-------
Data taken from https://dm.kaist.ac.kr/datasets/animal-10n/\

Note
----
Please make sure to load your data where indicated and uncomment the lines for loading data, normalizing, fitting, and evaluating the model. This code assumes that your images are 64x64 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB). If your images are of a different size or are grayscale, please adjust the input_shape argument accordingly. This code also assumes that your labels are already in binary format (i.e., 0 or 1). If they are not, you may need to preprocess your labels
